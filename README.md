# LSTM-live-cripto-forecast
This project walks through the training of an LSTM neural network to forecast Bitcoin prices in a web app. The web app is developed using the Python Dash framework, and every 10 seconds it forecasts 50 timesteps ahead (in minutes and hours) based on live data provided by Binance exchange APIs.
